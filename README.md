# Biped-robot-simulation-and-gait-classification

\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed and trained a biped robot using various reinforcement learning algorithms, including DDPG, TD3, and PPO, in MATLAB Simulink to enable stable walking behavior.
    \item Conducted walking simulations with the trained robot to collect sensor data for each joint and applied techniques such as Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) for dimensionality reduction and data correction.
    \item Utilized classification techniques to identify which reinforcement learning algorithm was used for each walking pattern, experimenting with models like ResNet, Transformer, and XGBoost.
    \item Aimed to improve model accuracy by incorporating additional deep learning and machine learning methods, with the ultimate goal of distinguishing between abnormal and normal walking patterns.
